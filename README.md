## Introduction

PXML Reader is designed to simplify the process of reading and modifying .pxml files. It provides a straightforward interface for manipulating PXML data structures.

## PXML Standard

The PXML standard, created by ebawe, is a comprehensive XML-based format used for efficient data interchange. It is widely used in various industries for its robustness and flexibility. For more information, refer to the [PXML Specification 1.3](https://www.pxml.eu/PXML-Specification-1.3-EN.pdf).

## Usage/Examples

```python
from PXML_Reader import *

# Read a file
file_path = "//path/to/your/file"
pxml_obj = pxml(file_path)

# Modify a file
pxml_obj.DocInfo.Comment = "test"  # Refer to PXML documentation for the correct value position

element = elementinfo.ElementInfo("test", True, "test", "test", "test", "test", 1, 1.0, 1.0, "test", "test", [])
element.ElementInfoVal.append(eleminfoval.ElemInfoVal(Type="test", V="test"))
pxml_obj.Order[0].Product[0].ElementInfo.append(element)

# Save the file
with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='UTF-8') as file:
    file.write(pxml_obj.__xml__())
```
